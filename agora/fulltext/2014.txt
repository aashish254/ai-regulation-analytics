9. Collaboration and Public Engagement: We will actively engage with stakeholders, such as users, experts, policymakers, and community organizations, to solicit diverse perspectives and feedback on the AI technology under consideration or currently used. We will seek to foster collaboration and share knowledge to address ethical challenges and ensure that AI technologies benefit society as a whole. 


10. Continuous Monitoring and Ethical Improvement: We will continuously strive to improve the ethical aspects of our AI technology through research, innovation, and learning from our experiences. We will keep abreast of emerging ethical guidelines and best practices, adapting our policies and practices accordingly. 
11. Training Programs: We will provide training programs and resources to employees involved in AI system development and utilization, promoting AI literacy, ethical considerations, privacy protection, and responsible AI practices. 


12. Compliance and Legal Frameworks: We will comply with applicable laws, standards and regulations related to AI and data protection. We will actively support the development of ethical AI regulations and frameworks that align with our principles and contribute to the responsible use of AI technology. 


This ethical AI policy statement reflects our commitment to responsible and ethical AI. We recognize that ethical considerations are paramount, and we will hold ourselves accountable to these principles as we work towards creating AI technologies that benefit humanity and contribute positively to our collective future.
