SEC. 2. Definitions.


In this Act:


(1) AGENCY.—The term “agency” has the meaning given that term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.


(2) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM.—The term “artificial intelligence system” means a machine-based system that, for an explicit or implicit objective, infers how to generate outputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments, from the input the system receives.


(3) REDUNDANT.—The term “redundant” means a regulation that duplicates, overlaps with, or serves the same purpose as another regulation, such that the elimination of the regulation would not result in a loss of essential information or regulatory function.


(4) REGULATION.—The term “regulation” has the meaning given the term “rule” in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.


(5) OUTDATED.—The term “outdated” means a regulation that has been superseded by more recent legislation, technological advances, or regulatory developments, rendering the regulation inapplicable or unenforceable.


SEC. 3. Annual artificial intelligence review of the code of federal regulations.


(a) In general.—Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall implement a process for identifying redundant or outdated regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations using an artificial intelligence system.


(b) Artificial intelligence system.—The process established under subsection (a) shall employ an artificial intelligence system that meets strict standards, as set out by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, for accuracy, transparency, accountability, and national security risk.


(c) Review of process and artificial intelligence system.—Not less frequently than once per fiscal year, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in coordination with the head of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall review and, as appropriate, revise the process established under subsection (a) to ensure that—


(1) the process is functioning properly and efficiently; and


(2) the underlying artificial intelligence system involved in such process still meets the criteria under subsection (b).


(d) Review of regulations.—


(1) REFERRAL AND REVIEW.—A regulation that is identified as redundant or outdated using the process established under subsection (a) shall be immediately referred to the agency responsible for promulgating the regulation for review by that agency.
