Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly finds that:


(a) Increasingly, insurers use external consumer data and information sources, as well as algorithms and predictive models using external consumer data and information sources, in their insurance rating, underwriting, claims, and other business practices;


(b) Although such tools have the potential to benefit insurers and consumers by simplifying and expediting insurance rating, underwriting, and claims processes, the accuracy and reliability of external consumer data and information sources can vary greatly, and some algorithms and predictive models may lack a sufficient rationale for use in insurance practices; and 


(c) The use of particular external consumer data and information sources, as well as algorithms and predictive models using external consumer data and information sources, by insurers may have a significant negative impact not only on the availability and affordability of insurance for protected classes of consumers, but also on the utilization of such insurance. 


(2) The general assembly therefore declares that in order to ensure that all Colorado residents have fair and equitable access to insurance products, it is necessary to: 


(a) Prohibit: 
(I) Unfair discrimination based on race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, or gender expression in any insurance practice; and 
(II) The use of external consumer data and information sources, as well as algorithms and predictive models using external consumer data and information sources, which use has the result of unfairly discriminating based on race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, or gender expression; and 


(b) After notice and rule-making by the commissioner of insurance, require insurers that use external consumer data and information sources, algorithms, and predictive models to control for, or otherwise demonstrate that such use does not result in, unfair discrimination. 


SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, add 10-3-1104.9 as follows: 


10-3-1104.9. Insurers' use of external consumer data and information sources, algorithms, and predictive models - unfair discrimination prohibited - rules - stakeholder process required - investigations - definitions - repeal. (1) IN ADDITION TO THE METHODS AND PRACTICES PROHIBITED PURSUANT TO SECTION 10-3-1104 (1)(f), AN INSURER SHALL NOT, WITH REGARD TO ANY INSURANCE PRACTICE: 


(a) UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATE BASED ON RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL OR ETHNIC ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DISABILITY, GENDER IDENTITY, OR GENDER EXPRESSION; OR 


(b) PURSUANT TO RULES ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSIONER, USE ANY EXTERNAL CONSUMER DATA AND INFORMATION SOURCES, AS WELL AS ANY ALGORITHMS OR PREDICTIVE MODELS THAT USE EXTERNAL CONSUMER DATA AND INFORMATION SOURCES, IN A WAY THAT UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES BASED ON RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL OR ETHNIC ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DISABILITY, GENDER IDENTITY, OR GENDER EXPRESSION. 


(2) (a) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ADOPT RULES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SECTION. 


(b) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ENGAGE IN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF RULES FOR ANY TYPE OF INSURANCE THAT INCLUDES CARRIERS, PRODUCERS, CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVES, AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES.

THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PROVIDE NOTICE OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ON THE DIVISION WEBSITE, AND STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS SHALL BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. 


(3) (a) AFTER THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS DESCRIBED IN SUBSECTION (2) OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ADOPT RULES FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF INSURANCE, BY INSURANCE PRACTICE, WHICH RULES ESTABLISH MEANS BY WHICH AN INSURER MAY DEMONSTRATE, TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE, THAT IT HAS TESTED WHETHER ITS USE OF EXTERNAL CONSUMER DATA AND INFORMATION SOURCES, AS WELL AS ALGORITHMS OR PREDICTIVE MODELS USING EXTERNAL CONSUMER DATA AND INFORMATION SOURCES, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES BASED ON RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL OR ETHNIC ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DISABILITY, GENDER IDENTITY, OR GENDER EXPRESSION. THE RULES SHALL NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2023, AT THE EARLIEST, FOR ANY TYPE OF INSURANCE, AND THE COMMISSIONER SHALL CONSIDER SOLVENCY IMPACTS, IF ANY, TO INSURERS IN ADOPTING THE RULES. 


(b) RULES ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION MUST REQUIRE EACH INSURER TO:

(II) PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE INSURER USES EXTERNAL CONSUMER DATA AND INFORMATION SOURCES, AS WELL AS ALGORITHMS AND PREDICTIVE MODELS USING EXTERNAL CONSUMER DATA AND INFORMATION SOURCES, FOR THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF INSURANCE AND INSURANCE PRACTICE; 
(III) ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK OR SIMILAR PROCESSES OR PROCEDURES THAT ARE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETERMINE, TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE, WHETHER THE INSURER'S USE OF EXTERNAL CONSUMER DATA AND INFORMATION SOURCES, AS WELL AS ALGORITHMS AND PREDICTIVE MODELS USING EXTERNAL CONSUMER DATA AND INFORMATION SOURCES, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES BASED ON RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL OR ETHNIC ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DISABILITY, GENDER IDENTITY, OR GENDER EXPRESSION; 
(IV) PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RESULTS OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK OR SIMILAR PROCESSES OR PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS TAKEN TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION, INCLUDING ONGOING MONITORING; AND

(d) DOCUMENTS, MATERIALS, AND OTHER INFORMATION IN THE POSSESSION OR CONTROL OF THE DIVISION THAT ARE OBTAINED BY, CREATED BY, OR DISCLOSED TO THE COMMISSIONER OR ANY OTHER PERSON PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION OR ANY RULES ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION ARE RECOGNIZED AS PROPRIETARY AND CONTAINING TRADE SECRETS.
