The Attorney General may require that a developer disclose to the Attorney General any statement or documentation described in this chapter if such statement or documentation is relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General. The Attorney General may also require that a deployer disclose to the Attorney General any risk management policy designed and implemented, impact assessment completed, or record maintained pursuant to this chapter if such risk management policy, impact assessment, or record is relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General.

G. In an action brought by the Attorney General pursuant to this section, it shall be an affirmative defense that the developer or deployer (i) discovers a violation of any provision of this chapter through red-teaming or other method; (ii) no later than 45 days after discovering such violation (a) cures such violation and (b) provides notice to the Attorney General in a form and manner as prescribed by the Attorney General that such violation has been cured and evidence that any harm caused by such violation has been mitigated; and (iii) is otherwise in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

H. Prior to causing an action against a developer or deployer for a violation of this chapter pursuant to subsection C, the Attorney General shall determine, in consultation with the developer or deployer, if it is possible to cure the violation. If it is possible to cure such violation, the Attorney General may issue a notice of violation to the developer or deployer and afford the developer or deployer the opportunity to cure such violation within 45 days of the receipt of such notice of violation. In determining whether to grant such opportunity to cure such violation, the Attorney General shall consider (i) the number of violations; (ii) the size and complexity of the developer or deployer; (iii) the nature and extent of the developer's or deployer's business; (iv) the substantial likelihood of injury to the public; (v) the safety of persons or property; and (vi) whether such violation was likely caused by human or technical error. If the developer or deployer fails to cure such violation within 45 days of the receipt of such notice of violation, the Attorney General may proceed with such action.

I. Nothing in this chapter shall create a private cause of action in favor of any person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter.
