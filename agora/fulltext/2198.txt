A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
To request the Joint Legislative Committee on Technology and Cybersecurity to study and make recommendations with respect to the use and regulation of artificial intelligence.


WHEREAS, the Legislature of Louisiana recognizes its responsibility for the health, safety, and welfare of the state's citizens and is increasingly concerned about how artificial intelligence, if used with nefarious intent, may pose a threat to the well-being of those citizens; and


WHEREAS, the potential threats are multifaceted and do not fall squarelywithin the subject matter jurisdiction of any particular legislative committee as prescribed by the rules of the respective chambers; and


WHEREAS, education policy is implicated in the potential for using artificial intelligence to assist in test-taking and paper-writing, thus threatening the most common methods teachers at all levels use to assess what students have learned; and


WHEREAS, administration of criminal justice policy is implicated in the potential for manufacturing or otherwise manipulating evidence used in the prosecution of crimes; and


WHEREAS, financial policy is implicated in the potential for disruption of commercial transactions and currencyexchanges and the undermining of the trust that makes free enterprise possible; and


WHEREAS, health and welfare policy is implicated in the potential for artificial intelligence to be used for purposes of diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions and in the determination of health insurance coverage decisions; and


WHEREAS, the fiscal health of the state is implicated in the tools that artificial intelligence allows for disguising assets and transferring of wealth in ways and forms that are untraceable, which threatens the state's ability to collect revenue equitably and sufficiently to fund state services; and


WHEREAS, the legislature also recognizes there may be beneficent uses of artificial intelligence that could improve the operations of state government and the efficiency and effectiveness with which it administers services to citizens; and


WHEREAS, the legislature needs a great deal more information before it can begin to fashion policies that exploit the potential tools that artificial intelligence provides for governance while limiting its abuse by those who would do harm to our state and its citizens.


THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby request the Joint Legislative Committee on Technology and Cybersecurityto studyand make recommendations with respect to the use and regulation of artificial intelligence.


BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the joint committee shall actively solicit data and testimony from persons, entities, agencies, and institutions that it believes can contribute to its purpose.


BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the joint committee shall make annual reports on policy recommendations to the legislature
