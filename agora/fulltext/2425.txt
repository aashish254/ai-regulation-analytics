(a) Appropriation of Funds.--There is hereby appropriated to the 
Department of Commerce for fiscal year 2025, out of any funds in the 
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $500,000,000, to remain available 
until September 30, 2034, to modernize and secure Federal information 
technology systems through the deployment of commercial artificial

    (c) Moratorium.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), no 
        State or political subdivision thereof may enforce, during the 
        10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, any law or regulation of that State or a political 
        subdivision thereof limiting, restricting, or otherwise 
        regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial 
        intelligence systems, or automated decision systems entered 
        into interstate commerce.

                        documentation, civil liability, taxation, fee, 
                        or other requirement on artificial intelligence 
                        models, artificial intelligence systems, or 
                        automated decision systems unless such 
                        requirement--
                                    (I) is imposed under Federal law; 
                                or

            (2) Artificial intelligence model.--The term ``artificial 
        intelligence model'' means a software component of an 
        information system that implements artificial intelligence

        intelligence system'' means any data system, hardware, tool, or
