Section 1. Definitions

The following words shall, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings:—

"Algorithmic discrimination" means any condition in which the use of an artificial intelligence system results in an unlawful differential treatment or impact that disfavors an individual or group of individuals on the basis of their actual or perceived age, color, disability, ethnicity, genetic information, limited proficiency in the English language, national origin, race, religion, reproductive health, sex, veteran status, or other classification protected under the laws of this state or federal law.

"Algorithmic discrimination" does not include:

(1) the offer, license, or use of a high-risk artificial intelligence system by a developer or deployer for the sole purpose of:

(i) the developer's or deployer's self-testing to identify, mitigate, or prevent discrimination or otherwise ensure compliance with state and federal law; or

(ii) expanding an applicant, customer, or participant pool to increase diversity or redress historical discrimination; or

(2) an act or omission by or on behalf of a private club or other establishment that is not in fact open to the public, as set forth in Title II of the federal "Civil Rights Act of 1964", 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000a (e), as amended.

"Artificial intelligence system" means any machine-based system that, for any explicit or implicit objective, infers from the inputs the system receives how to generate outputs, including content, decisions, predictions, or recommendations, that can influence physical or virtual environments.
