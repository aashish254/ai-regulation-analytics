Section 1. AS 15.13 is amended by adding a new section to read:                                                  
 Sec. 15.13.093. Deepfake disclosure statement. (a) If a person knows or                                               
 reasonably should know that a communication includes a deepfake depicting a                                             
 candidate or political party in a manner intended to injure the reputation of the                                       
 candidate or party or otherwise deceive a voter, the person shall include the following                                 
 statement with the communication: "This communication has been manipulated or                                           
 generated by artificial intelligence." In a communication that includes an audio                                        
 component, the statement must be read in a manner that is easily heard. If the                                          
 communication includes a print or video component, the statement must be placed in                                      
 the communication so the statement is easily discernible, and, for a broadcast, cable,                                  
 satellite, Internet, or other digital communication, the statement must remain onscreen                               
       throughout the entirety of the communication.                                                                     
 (b)  In this section, "deepfake" means an image, audio recording, or video                                              
 recording of an individual's appearance, conduct, or spoken words that has been                                         
 created or manipulated with machine learning, natural language processing, or another                                   
 computational processing technique of similar or greater complexity in a manner to                                      
       create a realistic but false image, audio, or video that                                                          
                 (1)  appears to a reasonable person to depict a real individual saying or                               
       doing something that did not actually occur; or                                                                   
                 (2)  provides a fundamentally different understanding or impression of                                  
 an individual's appearance, conduct, or spoken words than the understanding a                                           
       reasonable person would have from an unaltered, original version of the media.
